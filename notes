I initially wanted to enhance proof system's handling of easy arithmetic cases to reduce IO cost,
only querying cvc4 on "Neither".
This didn't improve things much because the first few queries are always Neither anyway,
most of them look something like:
  L0, L1 : Real;
  ASSERT L0 > L1;
So if performance is really importance, it might be useful to distinguish between
"definitely neither" and "maybe neither".

TODO:

intros 1 2 3, dvh 1 2 3, sum, max can now be verified but with longer run-time (still under 1s though)

mult won't be easily solved because the contract is at "sqr" while the invariant should have been maintained at "mult". Simply adding (>=/c 0) to mult's range contract makes the verification go through though.
improve + clean up âŠ‘

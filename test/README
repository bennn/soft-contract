Each test is given 20 minutes to run.

To run all tests and print out results, run:
> racket run.rkt
There will be a long initial delay.
In pretty-printed results, elipses (...) stand for free variables,
and L₁, L₂, etc. stand for a labels.

To run only specific tests, for example, only foldr and foldl, run:
> racket run-all.rkt -v foldl.sch foldr.sch

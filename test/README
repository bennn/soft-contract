Each test is given 5 minutes to run.

To run all tests and print out results, run:
> racket run.rkt -v
There will be a long initial delay.
In pretty-printed results, elipses (...) stand for free variables,
and (L n) stands for a label named n.

To run only specific tests, for example, only foldr and foldl, run:
> racket run-all.rkt -v foldl.sch foldr.sch

To also dump the heap, use -V rather than -v.

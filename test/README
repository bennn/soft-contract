Each test is given 5 minutes to run.

To run all tests and print out results, run:
> racket run-all.rkt

To run only the enhanced interpreter with heap refinements
and see elaborate results, run:
> racket run-all.rkt -v
In pretty-printed results, elipses (...) stand for free variables,
and (L n) stands for a label named n.

To run only specific tests, for example, only foldr and foldl, run:
> racket run-all.rkt foldl.sch foldr.sch
or in verbose mode:
> racket run-all.rkt -v foldl.sch foldr.sch
